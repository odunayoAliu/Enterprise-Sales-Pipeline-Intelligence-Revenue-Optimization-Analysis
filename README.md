# Enterprise-Sales-Pipeline-Intelligence-Revenue-Optimization-Analysis
This project delivers a comprehensive enterprise-level analysis of a global B2B sales pipeline consisting of 11,750 deals across multiple product categories and sales representatives.
The objective is to evaluate revenue performance, pipeline efficiency, sales velocity, stage leakage, probability calibration, and representative productivity — ultimately identifying strategic levers to improve revenue realization and reduce pipeline inefficiencies.
